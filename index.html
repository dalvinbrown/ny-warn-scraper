          The way patrons experience dining out has changed tremendously since
          coronavirus cases began cropping up in the U.S. In NYC, restaurants
          shed jobs quickly -- some before the pandemic was declared.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Restaurants that were buzzing with patrons just two months ago, have sat empty for weeks.  Others have shifted to a take-out or to-go model. Official
          advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
          outright bans issued from municipalities have lowered the number of
          people permitted to gather in the interest of promoting social
          distancing.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          There are now "contactless" delivery options. Major restaurant chains
          are removing seats so people can't hang around. And the situation is
          continuing to evolve. The dinner reservation app OpenTable released
          new data showing just how severe the situation is. Restaurant dining
          was down 42% in the U.S. in March, the data suggests. In states
          like Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, eating out has
          dropped more than 50%.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          One of the primary impacts restaurant-goers might notice is just how
          often staff are wiping down surfaces that are touched by multiple
          people, according to Norris Gearhart, a disaster response consultant
          for the restaurant industry. "To give people peace of mind, what they
          are doing is going in and doing a deep clean of all horizontal
          surfaces," Gearhart said. "Then they're consistently going back over
          all the nonporous surfaces with a disinfectant."

          Some restaurants are requiring all front-of-house workers to wear
          gloves, others are removing bar stools and some are requiring guests
          to pack their own leftovers. Restaurant owners are also looking into
          ways to cut down on face-to-face contact between staff and patrons.
          "People are less inclined to deal with cashiers and the adoption of
          technology is taking over," said Sam Zietz, CEO of TouchSuite which
          develops checkout kiosks. He noted that some restaurant clients are
          putting hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes near self-checkout
          counters to give patrons peace of mind.

          The shift in dining habits came as several locales instituted new
          restaurant guidelines in the wake of the pandemic. In New York City,
          for example, all restaurants, bars and cafes shifted to a food
          take-out and delivery only model.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Fears surrounding the outbreak left workers without jobs, and some
          were cut more than a week before global health agencies declared
          COVID-19 a pandemic, government data suggests. There wasn't a sinlge
          case of widespread restaurant layoffs in January in February in the
          New York City area, data from the state's labor department suggests.
          But in March, cases spiked on the 3rd of the month, and then again
          within two days of the pandemic declaration.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Owners of independent restaurants were tossed a lifeline after
          companies like Grubhub deferred commission fees for impacted
          restaurateurs. "Local independent restaurants are the lifeblood of our
          communities and we must do everything we can to get them through this
          time of uncertainty," Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney said in a news
          statement. "With empty dining rooms, restaurants are depending on
          pickup and delivery orders more than ever." Grubhub said dine-in
          service was down as much as 75% by the end of March.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          While fewer people are sitting down at local restaurants, many are
          still grabbing fast food orders to-go, and restaurant chains are
          responding by modifying practices amidst contagion concerns. The foot
          traffic analytics platform Placer.ai released findings on Monday
          suggesting nationwide traffic for Starbucks, McDonald’s and
          Chick-fil-A is on the rise in March.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The platform noted, however, that the data "doesn’t mean that there
          will be no negative effects should the virus continue to have an
          impact over the coming weeks and months."
